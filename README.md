# Simple Scramjet Proxy (Static HTML)

Yo! This is a scram proxy slapped together by **Road.js**.  
Full disclosure: I am **terrible at HTML** and static code in general. I literally learned full-stack professionally just to be able to survive this chaos. So if stuff looks like garbage… congratulations, you found my dumpster. 😎  
I went full-on **Next.js nerd mode** and do I regret it? Hell YEA… JK, I *f***ing love it*. XOXOXO.  
If you enjoy this goofy, barely-working static proxy, drop a like, a star, or just scream into the void for me. This is my first GitHub release that isn’t a fork, skid, or some dumb sh*t nobody asked for. 🎉  
Feel free to **mess with it** however the hell you want. Want to break it? Add memes? Spam dumb sh*t in the code? Go ahead. It’s your proxy now, not mine—so don’t slide into my DMs crying about it.  
Real talk: programming is weird, life is weirder, and if you find a bug… probably it’s your fault, you magnificent dumbass. 😏  
So, have a **lovely day**, don’t crash your tabs, and remember: **Road.js loves you… kind of… maybe… f*** it, love ya anyway.**
